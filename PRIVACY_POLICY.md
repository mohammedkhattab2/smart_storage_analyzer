## Information We Don't Collect

Smart Storage Analyzer is built on a foundation of privacy. Here's what we **DON'T** do:

- ❌ **We do NOT collect any personal information**
- ❌ **We do NOT track your usage or behavior**
- ❌ **We do NOT share data with third parties**
- ❌ **We do NOT use analytics services**
- ❌ **We do NOT display advertisements**
- ❌ **We do NOT require user accounts or registration**
- ❌ **We do NOT access your contacts, photos, or personal files**
- ❌ **We do NOT connect to the internet for data transmission**

## How Smart Storage Analyzer Works

### Local Processing Only

All features of Smart Storage Analyzer operate entirely on your device:

- **Storage Analysis**: All calculations and analysis of your device storage happen locally
- **File Categorization**: Files are categorized on your device without any external processing
- **Statistics Generation**: All statistics and charts are generated on your device
- **Data Storage**: Any preferences or settings are stored locally on your device

### No Data Transmission

Smart Storage Analyzer does not transmit any data from your device:

- No cloud services are used
- No external servers are contacted
- No information leaves your device
- All operations are performed offline

## Permissions We Request

Smart Storage Analyzer requests the following permissions to function:

### Storage Permission
- **Purpose**: To read storage statistics and analyze file categories
- **What we access**: File sizes, types, and folder structures
- **What we DON'T access**: File contents, personal data within files
- **When it's used**: Only when you actively use the app to analyze storage

This permission is essential for the app's core functionality and is used solely to provide you with storage analysis features.

## Data Security

Since Smart Storage Analyzer doesn't collect or transmit any data, your information is inherently secure:

- ✅ **No risk of data breaches** as no data is stored on external servers
- ✅ **No risk of unauthorized access** as all processing is local
- ✅ **No risk of data interception** as no data is transmitted
- ✅ **Your storage information never leaves your device**

## User Rights

As we don't collect any personal data, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) don't apply. However, you always have control:

- **Complete Control**: You can revoke storage permissions at any time through your device settings
- **Immediate Effect**: Revoking permissions immediately stops the app from accessing your storage
- **No Residual Data**: Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored preferences

## Children's Privacy

Smart Storage Analyzer does not knowingly collect information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app operates the same way for all users - with complete privacy.

## Third-Party Services

Smart Storage Analyzer does not integrate with any third-party services:

- ✅ No advertising networks
- ✅ No analytics platforms
- ✅ No social media integrations
- ✅ No payment processors
- ✅ No crash reporting services

The app is completely self-contained and independent.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or for legal reasons. Changes will be communicated through:

- App update descriptions
- In-app notifications (if applicable)
- Updates to this document with a new "Last Updated" date

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Open Source Transparency

Smart Storage Analyzer is committed to transparency. While the app itself may not be open source, this privacy policy is publicly available and clearly states our privacy practices.
